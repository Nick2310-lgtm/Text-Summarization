# 📝 Text Summarization Web App

This is an NLP-based web application built during my internship project. The app performs **abstractive text summarization** using the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model from Hugging Face Transformers. It allows users to input long documents and receive concise, meaningful summaries.

## 📌 Internship Objective

As part of my internship, I was tasked with building an application that could automate document summarization to help in information retrieval and faster decision-making. This project achieves that using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Summarizes long input text into concise summaries.
- Web-based interface using **Streamlit**.
- Uses **pretrained transformer models** for high-quality output.
- Can be extended to summarize news articles, transcripts, or reports.
